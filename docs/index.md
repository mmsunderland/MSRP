# Welcome

> *"Beginning of the teaching, explaining to the heart, instructing the ignorant, to know all that exists, created by Ptah, brought into being by Thoth, the sky with its features, the earth and what is in it, the bend of the mountain, and what is washed by the primeval waters, consisting of all that is useful, illuminated by Ra, all that is made to grow upon earth, reported by the scribe of god's books in the House of Life Amenope son of Amenope"*
