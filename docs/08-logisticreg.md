# Logistic regression

This chapter provides resources on a specific type of regression that we often utilise at the Matilda Centre and one that is relevant to the field of mental health and substance use research and that is logistic regression. This type of regression differs from regular "linear" regression given that the outcome variable is considered categorical (either binary or multi-level) as opposed to continuous. So, for example, if you have a diagnostic variable that is your primary outcome coded as either 1 or 0 depending on whether the diagnosis is present or absent, then you could use logistic regression to determine significant associations with that diagnosis (in either a univariable or multivariable format). Standard logistic regressions tend to deal with binary outcomes, however it is possible to analyse categorical outcomes with more levels using either ordinal logistic regression (where there is a natural order to the categories) or multinomial logistic regression (where there is no order to the categories). This chapter will provide information on all regressions that involve categorical variables.

- *This book provides a great introduction to logistic regression and it is particularly helpful if you have already been introduced to linear regression. Chapters in the book cover topics such as multiple logistic regression, interpreting logistic regression results, model-building, assessing model fit, multinomial and ordinal logistic regression, and correlated binary data.
