# Logistic regression

This chapter provides resources on a specific type of regression that we often utilise at the Matilda Centre and one that is relevant to the field of mental health and substance use research and that is logistic regression. This type of regression differs from regular "linear" regression given that the outcome variable is considered categorical (either binary or multi-level) as opposed to continuous. So, for example, if you have a diagnostic variable that is your primary outcome coded as either 1 or 0 depending on whether the diagnosis is present or absent, then you could use logistic regression to determine significant associations with that diagnosis (in either a univariable or multivariable format). Standard logistic regressions tend to deal with binary outcomes, however it is possible to analyse categorical outcomes with more levels using either ordinal logistic regression (where there is a natural order to the categories) or multinomial logistic regression (where there is no order to the categories). This chapter will provide information on all regressions that involve categorical variables.   

## Journal Articles and Textbooks

Hosmer, D. W. and Lemeshow, S. (2013) Applied logistic regression. Wiley. 

- *This book provides a great introduction to logistic regression and it is particularly helpful if you have already been introduced to linear regression. Chapters in the book cover topics such as multiple logistic regression, interpreting logistic regression results, model-building, assessing model fit, multinomial and ordinal logistic regression, and correlated binary data. A copy of this textbook is available free online via Usyd library https://sydney.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/61USYD_INST/12rahnq/alma991019090819705106 *


Agresti, A. (2013) Categorical Data Analaysis. Chicester: Wiley. 

- *This text provide additional information on topics related to categorical data analysis over and above logistic regression, for example multinomial responses, loglinear models, random effects, etc. A copy of this textbook is available free online via usyd library https://sydney.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/61USYD_INST/12rahnq/alma991020517119705106 *

Burkner, P-C. and Vuorre, M. (2019) Oridinal regression models in psychology: A tutorial. Advances in Methods and Practices in Psychological Science, 2: 77-101.

- *I guess the title of this article says it all. This article goes in detail for the analysis of ordinal variables in comparison to treating them as linear. It also provides some examples of how to run these analyses in R.* 

Williams, R. (2014) Understanding and interpreting generalised ordered logit models. The Journal of Mathematical Sociology, 40: 7-20.

- *This article focuses on ordinal logistic regression and provides examples and specific models for analysing this type of data.* 


Williams, R. and Jorgensen, A. (2023) Comparing logit and probit coefficients between nested models. Social Science Research, 109. 

- *This article covers a niche but important topic in logistic regression, that is the problem of comparing coefficients or odds ratios between nested logistic regression models (a common practice in linear regression). This article discusses the problem, why we should be careful, and solutions for when you do want to compared coefficients across nested models. Highly recommended that you read this article* 

VanderWeele, T. J. and Knol, M. J. (2014) A tutorial on interaction. Epidemiological Methods, 3: 33-72. 

- *Another niche but highly important article focusing on interpretation of interactions and differences between additive and multiplicative scales in relation to linear, log-linear, and logistic regression models. Again highly recommended reading*

Chen, Q., Nian, H., Zhu, Y. et al. (2016) Too many covariates and too few cases? - A comparative study. Statistics in Medicine, 10: 4546-4558. 

- *An article on the specific topic of what to do when you want to look at many covariates but have small sample sizes in logistic regression. An interesting article but only worth a read if you find yourself in this situation.*

Johfre, S. S. and Freese, J. (2021) Reconsidering the reference category. Sociological methodology, 51: 253-269.

- *This article covers an important topic in logistic regression, the choice of reference categories. This mostly reflects the choice of reference categories when using categorial explanatory (or independent), so not strictly applied to only logistic regression, but something that we do often.*
