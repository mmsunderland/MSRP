# Missing data analysis

Unless you manage to get perfect retention rates or are able to achieve 100% response rates on a survey, you will at some stage need to conduct a missing data analysis. These types of analysis can be quite simple in terms of trying to understand whether there are any differences between completers vs non-completers on a range of data that you have available, testing different assumptions of missingness, or conducting some form of imputation to "fill in the blanks". This chapter provides overviews, guides, and software examples to conduct a range of missing data analyses.

-	*Excellent online textbook available here https://stefvanbuuren.name/fimd/ written by the same author who wrote the mice package for R. *

Enders, C. K. (2022). Applied missing data analysis. Second edition. Guilford Press. 

-	*Probably one of the go-to textbooks in terms of missing data analysis. They have also developed their own program to conduct missing data analysis in complex samples/analyses that are currently not available in other programs (see Blimp in software section). https://www.appliedmissingdata.com/ *

-	*Introduction and provides workflows and reporting guidelines for multiple imputation. It is commonly found that multiple imputation is a robust and widely used approach when data are missing at random.*

`	*Paper outlining the use of maximum likelihood for clinical or prevention studies when you have partial missing data on the outcome. Starts to become more complicated as they outline different type of missingness analyses using maximum likelihood. *

-	*Pretty self-explanatory paper providing some good advice regarding the use of multiple imputation and other methods and when you should use them. But take some of these rules of thumb with caution. *

-	*Discusses the additional complexity of using multiple imputation for multilevel data (e.g., when there are multiple levels or clustering in the data). Provides an introduction to the pan R package to address this issue. *

-	*Provides a nice basic overview of missing data procedures, the different types of missing data, and potential options for handling missing data. Also provides an excellent list of resources in terms of textbooks, etc and does a better job at that than this list! *

## Software

BLIMP https://www.appliedmissingdata.com/blimp 

-	*A dedicated software package for conducting latent variable modelling and imputation for incomplete data with up to three levels (i.e. multilevel models). This program can do imputation when you have multilevel models such as time nested in individuals and individuals nested in schools, etc.  *
