\emph{``The list could surely go on, and there is nothing more wonderful than a list, instrument of wondrous hypotyposis.''}

--- Umberto Eco
\end{quote}

This book was written to provide easy access to the series of Matilda Centre Statistic's curated lists of resources. The lists were assembled and annotated on a variety of topics tailored to the needs of researchers at the \href{https://www.sydney.edu.au/matilda-centre/}{Matilda Centre for Research in Mental Health and Substance Use}.

This book is a living and evolving document with regular additions made to each chapter as well as additional chapters based on further need. We encourage you to share this document widely and feel free to provide suggestions for additional resources, new chapters, or edits by contacting either \href{matthew.sunderland@sydney.edu.au}{Matthew Sunderland} or \href{tim.slade@sydney.edu.au}{Tim Slade}.

\hypertarget{usage}{%
\section{Usage}\label{usage}}

You will find each of the individual lists in the left hand column that focus on specific topics of interest. Within each list you will find several categories of resources including but not limited to textbooks, journal articles, example code, YouTube lectures and videos, and other useful websites or blogs.

This document was created using bookdown and the source code can be found on Github via clicking the ``View book source'' link at the bottom of the left hand column.

\chapter{Reproducible and replicable data analysis}\label{reproducible-and-replicable-data-analysis}}

This curated list provides resources to improve the reproducibility and replicability of your data analysis. In brief, these concepts represent the ability for anyone to take your analysis and be able to replicate and reproduce all your results. These concepts have always been important but have seen increasing attention given the replicability crisis in social psychology and science more broadly. Moreover, the open science movement and the ability to use online portals such as the OSF and GitHub have made these principles easier to implement. This list also contains useful guides on how to improve record keeping, organisation, coding, cleaning, and manipulating data while at the same time producing dynamic reports that track everything you do (and all the changes) during your data analysis. This list does rely heavily on using R software, but the same principles can be applied to other statistical software packages including Stata and SPSS. I would encourage more people to make the switch to R programming (it's not as hard as you might think). The main message is to use syntax/coding and annotate as much as possible! No more point-and-click or having to re-do tables in excel!!

In this list we cover some of the more commonly used statistical programs. This list is to provide introductory materials when starting to use a particular software package. In terms of getting access to these programs, you should be able to download SPSS and SAS from the University of Sydney IT services. Stata requires an individual licence, or it can be used for free remotely via the Usyd Citrix Workspace App. R and Rstudio (highly recommended) can be downloaded for free along with the many R packages (\url{https://www.r-project.org/} \url{https://rstudio.com/}). Mplus requires a license and we currently have a couple of copies of Mplus installed on the Matilda Stats computers (i.e., in Matt's office and on the Statistics's laptop).

\chapter{MLM and Latent growth models}\label{mlm-and-latent-growth-models}}

This list provides resources on multilevel models (MLM) and latent growth models for the analysis of longitudinal data. Both MLM and latent growth models are similar but different frameworks to analyse change over time. Both have strengths and weaknesses and both frameworks might be more or less suitable depending on the specific research question and the type of data that you want to analyse. Whilst MLM can be used for other types of clustered or multi-level structured data, we focus here on the use of MLM for repeated measures or longitudinal analysis.

\item
  \emph{Full playlist from the Mplus short course on regression and mediation where the above lecture was taken from. Covers more topics such as linear regression, count variable modelling, traditional mediation analysis, sensitivity analysis, Bayesian analysis, and missing data analysis.}
